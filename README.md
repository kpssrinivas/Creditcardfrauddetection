# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud detection is becoming really
problematic now a days with increasing online purchases there
are increasing Cyber attacks. Identifying them is very
important. In this document we will go through how we did the
analysis of a data set containing fraud and non fraud
transactions and using different ML algorithms how are we
able to predict the fraud cases.


Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine
Learning is a process of data investigation by a
Data Science team and the development of a
model that will provide the best results in
revealing
and
preventing
fraudulent
transactions. This is achieved through bringing
together all meaningful features of card users’
transactions, such as Date, User Zone, Product
Category, Amount, Provider, Client’s Behavioral
Patterns, etc.

In this Model we will be able to detect most of the Fraud cases using Random forest algorithm. 
We generally use *Random Forest Algorithm(RFA)* for finding the fraudulent transactions and the accuracy of those transactions.
This algorithm is based on supervised learning algorithm where it uses decision trees for classification of the dataset. 
After classification of dataset a confusion matrix is obtained. The performance of Random Forest Algorithm is evaluated based on the confusion matrix. 
The results obtained from processing the dataset gives accuracy of about **92%**
